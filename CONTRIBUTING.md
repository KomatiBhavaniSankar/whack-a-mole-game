## ✨ Code Guidelines

* **HTML:** Keep it semantic and accessible (use `alt`, proper tags, etc.)
* **CSS:** Prefer using classes over IDs for styling. Organize sections clearly.
* **JS:** Write clean, modular, ES6+ code. Avoid polluting global scope.
* **Naming:** Use meaningful, consistent naming for variables and classes.
* **Comments:** Use them wisely to explain logic, not what’s obvious.

Before committing:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click "Start Game".

   * Does the game break?
   * Is layout or styling affected?
4. Open dev tools (F12):

   * No console errors? Good job!
   * Console logs are for debugging only — remove before PR.
